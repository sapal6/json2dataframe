    "> Json2Dataframe started as an experiment to test the following questions in my mind -->\n",
    "   * Can I build a library quickly with [nbdev](!https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorial/)\n",
    "   * Can I build a way to use exisitng tool(s) to parse big JSON files and built Dataframes out of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "  json2Dataframe lazily reads the JSON files and then creates a Pandas dataframe with only the keys which are required by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Requirements\n",
    "  json2dataframe uses ijson to parse json files and Pandas to create dataframes. So you would need to have these two packages installed beforehand in case you are planning to extend this library or contribute. If you just wan to use this library then no need to worry as the 'pip install'command will take care of all dependencies for you.\n",
